    "The [article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/23/opinions/biden-climate-change-gillette-wyoming-coal-sutter/index.html) focuses on the town of Gilette, Wyoming, which accounts for 40% of the coal production in America. When we take into account that in [2019](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/energy-and-the-environment/where-greenhouse-gases-come-from.php#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20about%2046%25%20of,21%25%20came%20from%20burning%20coal.&text=The%20residential%20and%20commercial%20sectors,sector%20and%20the%20industrial%20sector.), 11% of all US energy consumption comes from coal, and that this coal production accounts for 21% of U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, we can estimate that Gilette makes up 4% of all US energy consumption and 8% of all energy-realted carbon dioxide emissions. \n",

    "In units, we can rephrase it as Gillete approximately accounts for 4 quadrillion BTU of US energy consumption and 410 million metric tons of CO2 emissions."
